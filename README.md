# Built for SIH 2025 | Government of Odisha | Electronics & IT Department

## üìã Problem Statement
### Develop an IoT-based monitoring system for solar or wind microgrids in rural areas, providing real-time data on energy generation, storage, and consumption. 
### The system should alert users to inefficiencies or maintenance needs and improve microgrid efficiency by 15%


# Hardware (microgrid prototype)

### Typical components used in the prototype (adjust to your actual BOM):
### ESP32 development board for data acquisition and MQTT/HTTP transmission
### Current sensors (e.g., SCT-013) or hall-effect sensors
### Voltage sensing divider (for AC/DC measurement where required)
### Solar panel(s) and charge controller
### Battery (Li-ion / lead-acid) with BMS
### Wiring, connectors, prototyping board / enclosure
